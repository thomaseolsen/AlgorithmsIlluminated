# Part 1 - 1.2 Integer Multiplication

## Grade School Algorithm
In running tests of this algorithm, I had to change my base test markup from Milliseconds to at least Microseconds. This showed the difference between the base C++ multiplication method and my Grade School Algorithm. Extending this further to Nanoseconds looks to be the best option for this algorithm sample because the C++ base method runs in nanoseconds.
